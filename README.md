#### The app is a simple Tech Expo Scout

#### **By Pat Aloo 10/10/2023**

## Project Description
    It is a simple expo scout app that allows users to view upcoming tech events and conferences all over the world. It also allows event organizers to log in their own upcoming events.

## MVP
#### As a User I can:
    1. See a list of upcoming events on the left side of the application page.

    2. See the details of the first event/expo logged in the middle part of the page.

    3. I can get a ticket to a specific event by clicking the 'Get Ticket' button.

    4. If I am an organizer who wishes to log my own upcoming event onto the app for the public, I can do so by filling in the form on the right side of the page.

    5. As an organizer, I can also delete my logged event by clicking the 'DELETE' button.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
